# KMeans-SupplyChain-Clustering
K-Means clustering project analyzing supply chain delay patterns using unsupervised learning on logistics data.
This project applies K-Means Clustering on a smart logistics dataset to segment supply chain operations based on delay characteristics.
# Objective
To identify operational clusters that explain shipment delays using unsupervised learning, and generate actionable insights for logistics optimization.

## Methods Used
- Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Elbow Method + Silhouette Score
- K-Means Clustering (k=3)
- PCA for visualization
- Radar Chart, Boxplots, PairPlot
